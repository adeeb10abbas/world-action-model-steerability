# Complete the SGW scene package

**Completed 24 September 2026, 12:29 UTC.** The [final registry](../../artifacts/workshops/spatial_grounding_v1/scene_package_20260924/scene-registry.json) selects 87 layouts with 522 passing scripted trials and the required family/side/stage balance. Eight rejected candidates remain recorded. The finite batch stopped with no model requests or learned-policy episodes. The plan below is retained as the record of the authorized work; it is not a request to rerun it.

User direction, 24 September 2026 UTC: finish every scene family before cluster handoff; create a dedicated repository; avoid redundant checking. Latest instruction: do everything EXCEPT launching the 1,044-episode study. Learned-policy execution belongs on the cluster and is not authorized in this task.

## Acceptance

- LAT, HEIGHT and DIST each have 29 distinct selected layouts.
- Each selected layout has both physical goals demonstrated across three resets with the existing 450-action controller and unchanged scoring.
- LAT approach side, HEIGHT upper-support side and DIST bowl side are explicit, with two layouts per side in development and twelve per side in confirmation; one declared pilot side.
- Keep previous valid physical failures and immutable inputs. Reuse working geometry and completed physical evidence; do not repeat historical novelty checks.
- Record native videos, measured reset poses and cameras. Package exact design inputs and compact receipts; raw arrays stay outside Git.
- The new private repository contains essential code, fixed prompts/protocol/queue, dependency pins and one clear scene-to-experiment handoff. No generic claim of completed model experiments follows from scripted trials.

## Work units

1. **DIST geometry:** `scene_completion_dist_flat.py` places the cube, bowl and plate directly on the table. Test initial distance neutrality in 3D, both goal signs, clear transfer paths and both bowl arrangements. The earlier pedestal inputs are superseded and their partial attempts are retained separately.
2. **LAT balance:** new `scene_completion_lat.py` and focused tests; complement the existing robot-right approach pool with left approach inputs. Keep world-left as +y under either arrangement.
3. **Native integration:** new `scene_completion_runner.py`, leaving frozen running source unchanged. Include plate in candidate/reset/scoring objects, measured DIST support targets and side labels. Test these CPU contracts before native execution.
4. **Bounded runs:** finish each current candidate, temporarily schedule the missing prototype orientations on an owned GPU, then consume finite pre-recorded pools. Existing HEIGHT evidence is reused unchanged. Preserve failed and interrupted records. Never interrupt cluster workers.
5. **Final selection/package:** select accepted layouts in declared order with side quotas, copy compact inputs/receipts and representative videos, and check only count/identity/side/scoring contracts needed for the handoff. No repeated exhaustive checks of unchanged assets.
6. **Standalone repository:** private `adeeb10abbas/world-action-model-steerability`; essential import closure, external pinned RoboLab/model runtimes, paper and the 1,044-cell queue. Show remaining gaps plainly until final receipts exist.

## Practical execution

Two RTX 3090s run this task's scripted qualification. The original LAT/HEIGHT loops have ended; their completed candidate receipts are reused by the new coordinator. Each GPU may run two independent single-environment checks, following the declared finite order and side quotas. Native runs use a frozen source snapshot and headless display settings. Stop only for concrete infrastructure failure, lack of space, or an exhausted declared pool; diagnose from retained evidence and register a new geometry revision when necessary. Do not rerun valid failures to improve a denominator.

The substantial cost is native physics/rendering, not paperwork. CPU tests, packaging and source migration proceed while native trials run. The task is complete only when the actual selected scene package passes the acceptance above; a launched batch is progress, not completion.
